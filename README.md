# Whistlepost Launcher

Bootstrap configurations for the Whistlepost platform

## Getting Started

Use the following command to launch Whistlepost:

    $ make build launch

If you don't have `make` installed (e.g. on Windows, etc.), you can also run:

    $ ./mvnw build launch # use: mvnw.cmd for Windows

This will provide you with a Whistlepost instance accessible at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
